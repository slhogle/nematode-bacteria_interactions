## Reproducibility

The project uses [`renv`](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/index.html) to create a reproducible environment to execute the code in this project. [See here](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html#collaboration) for a brief overview on collaboration and reproduction of the entire project. 
To get up and running from an established repository, you could do:

``` r
install.packages("renv")
renv::restore()
```

To initiate `renv` for a new project:

``` r
install.packages("renv")
# initialize
renv::init()
# install some new packages
renv::install("tidyverse")
# record those packages in the lockfile
renv::snapshot()
```

```{r}
#| eval: true
#| echo: false
#| output: false
#| error: false
#| warning: false
# If you want to automoate setting up some general directory structure you can do that here in a quarto chunk
# that does not get output to the final HTML. 

# Setup project structure
library(here)
library(fs)

# define directory paths and overall structure
# the _data_raw directory is never touched or modified! 
# All downstream work and intermediate results should be put in the data directory
